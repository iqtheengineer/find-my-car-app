# Find My Car üöóüìç

## Project Overview
**Find My Car** is a mobile app designed to help users easily remember where they parked their car using Meta Ray-Ban glasses and GPS technology. By using voice commands like "Save my parking spot" and "Where's my car?", the app saves the location of your parked car and provides walking directions back to it when needed. This project leverages the Meta Ray-Ban glasses for hands-free interaction and Google Maps API for navigation, making it a practical solution for anyone who frequently forgets their parking spot.

## Features
- **Voice Command Integration**: Save and retrieve parking locations using simple voice commands through the Meta Ray-Ban glasses.
- **GPS Location Capture**: Automatically capture the GPS coordinates of your parking spot.
- **Navigation Assistance**: Use Google Maps to generate directions from your current location back to your parked car.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Optionally store your parking location in Google Cloud for access across devices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive app interface for viewing saved parking spots and navigating back.

## Tech Stack
- **Meta Ray-Ban SDK**: To capture voice commands and interact with the glasses.
- **React Native**: For building a cross-platform mobile app (iOS and Android).
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Optional storage of GPS data using Cloud Storage.
- **Google Maps API**: For generating navigation routes to the saved parking spot.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines, including testing and security checks.
